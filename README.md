Ray Tracer Part 1
by Jimmy Zhang
Result: output is a blank blue page, still trying to debug
What I have done: I did the triangle-line and sphere-line intersections and put through several sets of data through each of them
How I did them: for the triangle-line function, i wrote three functions with three variables and first took the third variable out of the equations by elimination
Current Problem: With the test datas I made myself according to how you answered me during the 1v1 session some sets of data to test my code, 
well when I used them, the code worked as it is supposed to be, However, when I used a nnf file, all the deltas were less than zero, I'm still trying to figure out what went wrong here
I  put a picture of my notebook showing my testing process in the repository named testcases.jpg
Code is in the repository named: trace.cpp
